**STAC** is an exclusive platform for artists, designed to foster creativity through themed challenges and sponsor collaborations. Similar to platforms like **Behance**, **Dribbble**, or **Pinterest**, STAC enables users to post, share, and showcase their work within a creative community. However, the core distinction lies in the unique **monthly theme requirement**: every month, a new **specific theme** is introduced, and users must submit artwork related to that theme to be featured and published.

The platform also offers a significant benefit to **pro users**: the opportunity to participate in **sponsor challenges**, where winning artwork is guaranteed to be featured in **collaborations with world-renowned brands**.
